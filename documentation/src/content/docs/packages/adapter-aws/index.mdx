import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import FileTree from '../../../../components/file-tree/index.astro';


## Getting Started

Install the adapter by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install --save-dev @svelte.kit/adapter-aws
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install --save-dev @svelte.kit/adapter-aws
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn add --dev @svelte.kit/adapter-aws
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configure SvelteKit.

Add the adapter to your SvelteKit config.

```js
// svelte.config.js
import adapter from '@svelte.kit/adapter-aws'
import { vitePreprocess } from '@sveltejs/kit/vite'

/** @type {import('@sveltejs/kit').Config} */
export default {
  preprocess: vitePreprocess(),
  kit: {
    adapter: adapter(),
  },
}
```

## Build the Project

Test the adapter by running the appropriate command in your terminal.
If you have an equivalent build script in your `package.json`, you may run that instead.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm run vite build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm run vite build
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn vite build
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Project Structure

After building the project, a new `build` directory will be created in your project root.
This directory is organized into subdirectories depending on where they should be uploaded to AWS.

This sample project structure is based off the create-svelte's [Sverdle template](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte/templates/default).
Below is an overview of files you can expect to find in a Sverdle project that's been built with `@svelte.kit/adapter-aws`.

### Generated Directories
The build output for `@svelte.kit/adapter-aws` is organized into three directories:
`build/lambda`, `build/s3`, and `build/lambda@edge`.

### build/lambda
This directory contains the primary Lambda handler function that runs during SSR and API requrests.
It's based off [@sveltejs/adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)
and starts up a [polka web-server](https://github.com/lukeed/polka) with specialized middleware to handle requests.

(TODO/WIP is migrating to [uwebsockets for that blazingly fast performance](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets.js).

Because it's based off the Node.js adapter which reads and serves files directly from
the file system, pre-rendered pages are also uploaded with the function.


### build/s3
This directory contains all static assets should be uploaded to S3.

Notably, this includes [SvelteKit's app directory](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#appdir),
which defaults to `_app/`. All static assets are fetched from this path on the built website.

### build/lambda@edge
This directory contains the Lambda@Edge handler function that runs during CloudFront requests.

The motivation for having a Lambda@Edge handler is to perform redirects intended for pre-rendered
pages so that it correctly hits the S3 origin. Typically, the `build/s3` directory is
uploaded to AWS S3, and then served through the CloudFront CDN.

A limitation of this setup is that routes like `/about` can be forwarded to the S3 origin
but not actually match any files because the file is actually at `/about.html`.
The Lambda@Edge handler will intercept all equivalent requests to the about page, e.g.
`/about`, `/about/index`, `/about/index.html`, and redirect them to `/about.html`.


## Configuration Options
This adapter accepts the same configuration options as
[@sveltejs/adapter-node](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node)
in addition to options specifying the desired folders in the build output.

- `s3Directory` (default: `s3`) - The directory to upload to S3.
- `lambdaDirectory` (default: `lambda`) - The directory to upload to Lambda.
- `lambdaEdgeDirectory` (default: `lambda@edge`) - The directory to upload to Lambda@Edge.

The options from adapter-node are also documented here for completeness:
- precompress (default: `false`) - Whether to precompress static assets with brotli and gzip.
- out (default: `build`) - The directory to write the built files to.
- polyfill (default: `true`) - Whether to include polyfills for legacy browsers.
- envPrefix (default: '') - The prefix to use for environment variables.

### Configuration TODO
It will read from the nearest `svelte.config.js` to make more informed decisions about the build procedure.
