description: Integrate with the AWS CDK deployment framework with @svelte.kit/cdk.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import FileTree from '../../../../components/file-tree/index.astro';


## Getting Started

Install the adapter by running the following command in your terminal:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm install --save-dev @svelte.kit/cdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn add --dev @svelte.kit/cdk
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm install --save-dev @svelte.kit/cdk
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Create a CDK App

It's completely fine to perform all these stops at the top level of the module.
The example encapsulates it in a `main` function that immediately executes.

```ts
import { App, Stack } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
import { SvelteKit } from '@svelte.kit/cdk';

function main() {
	const stackName = `sveltekit-adapter-aws-test`;

	const app = new App({ autoSynth: true });

  const stack = new Stack(app, stackName)

	new SvelteKit(stack, stackName);
}

main();
```

## Build the Project

This package is not responsible for building the project.
It expects 2-3 distinct directories to be available in the built contents:

- `lambda`
- `s3`
- `lambda@edge` (optional)


#### `lambda`

Should contain the primary Lambda handler function that runs during SSR and API requrests,
as well as pre-rendered pages.

#### `s3`

Should contain the static assets that are served from S3. e.g. everything in
[SvelteKit's app directory](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/configuration#appdir).

#### `lambda@edge`

Contains a Lambda@Edge function that runs during CloudFront requests to perform redirects to
static HTML files in S3.

For example, if a static HTML file is at `/about.html` in the S3 bucket, and the user requests
the `/about`, `/about/index`, or `/about/index.html` routes, the function should correctly
rewrite the URL path to `/about.html`, so it gets redirected by the CloudFront Distribution accordingly.


## Run the CDK app

Example commands are demonstrated below.
`tsx` is used as a fast and convenient TypeScript executor.
If `aws-cdk-lib` is installed in the current project, `yarn` and `pnpm` can
execute it directly. `npm` still requires `npx` to execute it.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npx cdk --app 'npx tsx tools/cdk/index.ts' deploy
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="yarn">

```sh
yarn cdk --app 'yarn tsx tools/cdk/index.ts' deploy
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm cdk --app 'pnpx tsx tools/cdk/index.ts' deploy
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Configuration

- out (default: `build`) - The directory to write the built files to.
- `s3Directory` (default: `s3`) - The directory to upload to S3.
- `lambdaDirectory` (default: `lambda`) - The directory to upload to Lambda.
- `lambdaEdgeDirectory` (default: `lambda@edge`) - The directory to upload to Lambda@Edge.
- `lambdaHandler` (default: `index.handler`) - The name of the Lambda handler function.
- `constructProps` (default: `{}`) - Directly customize/override props provided to the constructs.

### TODO
- [ ] (Successfully) read the config from the nearest `svelte.config.js`
  to automatically load the config used by `@svelte.kit/adapter-aws`.

  SvelteKit is setup weird so `JITI` and `module.createRequire` can't read it in their default configuration
